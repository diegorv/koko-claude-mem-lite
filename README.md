A privacy-first memory plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Automatically captures what happens during your coding sessions, compresses it with AI, and re-injects the context when you start a new session — so Claude remembers what you were working on.

## How It Works

memory-lite hooks into Claude Code's plugin lifecycle to silently observe your sessions:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ SessionStart│────▶│  Inject  │     │  Store   │     │  Generate   │
│   (hook)    │     │ Context  │     │Observation│     │  Summary    │
└─────────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘     └─────────────┘
                         ▲                ▲                  ▲
                         │                │                  │
                    On startup      Every tool use     On session end
                         │                │                  │
                    Reads past      Multi-turn AI      AI summarizes
                    summaries +     observer extracts  the full session
                    observations    structured data    into 5 fields
```

1. **Session starts** → The plugin fetches recent summaries and observations from past sessions and injects them as context, giving Claude memory of previous work.
2. **Every tool use** → The tool name, input, and output are sent to a persistent multi-turn observer conversation (or a single-turn fallback), which extracts a structured observation (type, title, facts, narrative, files read/modified).
3. **Session ends** → The last assistant message is summarized into 5 fields: what was requested, investigated, learned, completed, and what's next.

All data is stored locally in a SQLite database at `~/.memory-lite/data.db`. AI extraction uses Claude Code's own authentication (subscription billing via the Agent SDK) — **no separate API key is needed**.

## Features

- **Automatic context injection** — Past session summaries and recent observations are injected at the start of every new session
- **Multi-turn AI observer** — A persistent conversation with Claude Sonnet tracks tool uses across the session for better context, with SQLite-backed durable queue for crash recovery
- **Session summaries** — End-of-session summaries capture what was done and what's next
- **MCP search tools** — Three progressive-disclosure tools (`memory_search`, `memory_timeline`, `memory_get`) exposed as an MCP server for Claude to query its own memory
- **AI-powered cleanup** — Review and bulk-delete stale or low-signal observations via SSE-streamed AI analysis
- **Full-text search** — FTS5-powered search across all observations
- **Semantic search** — Optional vector search via Ollama + sqlite-vec for similarity-based queries
- **Privacy controls** — Wrap sensitive content in `<private>` tags to exclude it from storage
- **Deduplication** — Content-hash-based dedup within a 30-second window prevents duplicate observations
- **Web dashboard** — Browse sessions, observations, and summaries at `http://localhost:37888`
- **Configurable settings** — Live-editable settings via the dashboard or API
- **Graceful degradation** — If the worker is down, AI is unavailable, or Ollama isn't running, everything degrades silently without breaking Claude Code

### Hook Lifecycle

| Hook | Event | Action | Timeout |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `Setup` | Plugin setup | Installs native dependencies (`better-sqlite3`, `sqlite-vec`) | 300s |
| `SessionStart` (setup) | Any session start | Installs deps if missing | 300s |
| `SessionStart` (start) | Any session start | Spawns worker daemon if not already running | 60s |
| `SessionStart` (context) | Any session start | Injects memory context into session | 30s |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User sends a message | Creates/resumes session, stores prompt | 30s |
| `PostToolUse` | Any tool finishes | Multi-turn observer (or single-turn fallback) extracts structured observation | 120s |
| `Stop` | Claude stops responding | AI generates session summary | 60s |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ends | Marks session as completed | 15s |

### Worker Process

The worker is a background HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:37888`, built with [Hono](https://hono.dev)) that:

- Manages the SQLite database via `better-sqlite3`
- Hosts multi-turn `ObserverSession` instances, one per active Claude Code session
- Handles AI extraction calls (Claude Sonnet via Anthropic Agent SDK)
- Serves the dashboard UI static files
- Auto-spawns on first hook call if not running
- Writes its PID (as structured JSON `{ pid, port, startedAt }`) to `~/.memory-lite/worker.pid`
- Shuts down gracefully on SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP
- Logs to `~/.memory-lite/worker.log` (structured file logger)

#### Zombie Prevention & Resource Management

The worker has several safety mechanisms to prevent zombie processes and runaway CPU usage:

- **SDK subprocess cleanup** — Each `ObserverSession` holds a reference to the Claude Agent SDK `Query` object and calls `conversation.close()` on destroy. The `AbortController` is passed to the SDK so `abort()` kills the underlying CLI subprocess immediately.
- **SDK idle timeout** — If the SDK `for await` loop receives no messages for 5 minutes, the query is force-aborted to prevent hung subprocesses.
- **Stale session reaper** — A background timer (every 60s) checks all active observer sessions. Any session idle for more than 30 minutes is automatically destroyed — this is a safety net for when the `SessionEnd` hook doesn't fire.
- **Idle auto-shutdown** — If there are zero active sessions and no API requests for 30 minutes, the worker shuts itself down. It will be re-spawned automatically on the next Claude Code session start.
- **Duplicate worker detection** — On startup, the worker checks the PID file and health endpoint to prevent multiple instances. Stale PID files from crashed workers are cleaned up automatically.

#### Debugging

```bash
# Check worker health
curl -s http://localhost:37888/api/health

# View active observer sessions
curl -s http://localhost:37888/api/debug/sessions

# Check logs
cat ~/.memory-lite/worker.log

# Kill a stuck worker manually
lsof -ti :37888 | xargs kill
```

### Multi-turn Observer

Instead of a separate AI call per tool use, memory-lite maintains a persistent `ObserverSession` for each active Claude Code session. The observer:

- Runs a multi-turn conversation with Claude Sonnet as a specialized "observer" role
- Receives each tool use as a message and responds with structured XML observations
- Uses a SQLite-backed durable queue (`pending_messages` table) so messages survive worker crashes
- Stores the Agent SDK session ID so conversations can be resumed if the worker restarts
- Falls back to single-turn extraction if no observer session is available
- Properly cleans up SDK subprocesses on session destroy (via `Query.close()` + `AbortController`)
- Auto-destroyed after 30 minutes of inactivity by the stale session reaper

## Dashboard

The web dashboard is available at `http://localhost:37888` when the worker is running.

### Views

- **Feed** — Reverse-chronological stream of observations and summaries across all projects. Each observation card shows its type badge, title, narrative, extracted facts, and files read/modified.
- **Sessions** — Browse all sessions with observation counts and inline summaries. Click a session to see its full observation timeline.
- **Search** — Full-text search across all observations using SQLite FTS5.
- **Context** — Preview the exact memory context that will be injected into the next session, broken down by summaries and observations.
- **Settings** — View and edit plugin configuration live (changes saved to `~/.memory-lite/settings.json`).

### Stats Bar

- Total sessions, observations, summaries, and projects
- Observation type breakdown (bugfix, feature, refactor, discovery, decision, change)
- 7-day activity sparkline
- Worker uptime

## MCP Tools

memory-lite exposes an MCP server with three progressive-disclosure tools for Claude to search its own memory:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_search` | Step 1: FTS5 search returning a compact index of matching observations (IDs + snippets) |
| `memory_timeline` | Step 2: Get chronological context around a specific observation ID |
| `memory_get` | Step 3: Fetch full details for a specific set of observation IDs |

The progressive design keeps token usage low — start with a search, drill into the timeline, then fetch full details only for what's relevant.

## Context Injection

At the start of each session, memory-lite injects a Markdown context block containing:

1. **Recent summaries** (last 3 by default) — What was done, learned, and what's next
2. **Recent activity table** (last 50 observations) — Time, type, title, and files
3. **Full details** (last 5 observations) — Complete facts, narrative, and file lists

This context is wrapped in `<memory-lite-context>` tags, which are automatically stripped from any data stored back — preventing recursive storage.

## AI Cleanup

The dashboard includes an AI-powered cleanup tool that helps keep memory lean and high-signal:

1. Open the dashboard and navigate to a project's cleanup view
2. The worker streams items (via SSE) to the UI as "pending", then triggers Claude Sonnet to review each one
3. Claude recommends `KEEP` or `DELETE` with a reason, focusing on deleting low-value entries (routine edits, ephemeral build status, self-referential noise)
4. Review the recommendations and apply selected deletions in bulk

## Privacy

- **`<private>` tags** — Wrap any content in `<private>...</private>` in your prompts to exclude it from storage. Content inside these tags is stripped at the hook layer before reaching the worker or database.
- **Entirely private prompts** — If a prompt is entirely wrapped in `<private>` tags, the session is skipped entirely.
- **Local storage** — All data stays in `~/.memory-lite/data.db` on your machine.
- **No telemetry** — The only network calls are to the Anthropic API for observation extraction and summarization, using your existing Claude Code subscription.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `~/.memory-lite/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "WORKER_PORT": 37888,
  "OBSERVATION_COUNT": 50,
  "FULL_OBSERVATION_COUNT": 5,
  "SUMMARY_COUNT": 3,
  "OLLAMA_URL": "http://localhost:11434",
  "OLLAMA_MODEL": "bge-m3"
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `WORKER_PORT` | `37888` | Port for the worker HTTP server |
| `OBSERVATION_COUNT` | `50` | Number of recent observations to include in context |
| `FULL_OBSERVATION_COUNT` | `5` | Number of observations with full detail in context |
| `SUMMARY_COUNT` | `3` | Number of recent summaries to include in context |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server URL for embeddings |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `bge-m3` | Ollama model for generating embeddings |

All settings can be overridden via environment variables with the `MEMORY_LITE_` prefix (e.g., `MEMORY_LITE_WORKER_PORT=9999`). Settings can also be edited live via the dashboard Settings view or the `PUT /api/settings` endpoint.

## Semantic Search (Optional)

For similarity-based search beyond keyword matching:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and pull the embedding model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull bge-m3
   ```

2. Install the [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) extension (e.g., via Homebrew on macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install asg017/sqlite-vec/sqlite-vec
   ```

3. Restart the worker. Embeddings will be generated automatically for new observations, and semantic search will be available via the API:
   ```
   GET /api/search?q=authentication+flow&mode=semantic
   ```

If Ollama or sqlite-vec aren't available, everything continues to work — only semantic search is disabled.
